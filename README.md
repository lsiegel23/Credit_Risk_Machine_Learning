Credit Risk Resampling
My oversampling models had the highest balanced accuracy scores, with naive oversampling at 0.66.
In terms of recall oversampling had the highest scores - this time SMOTE the highest with 0.63.
Oversampling was, yet again, the highest for geometric mean, with naive oversampling the highest with a score of 0.63.

Credit Risk Ensemble
For the ensemble models, I was sure to scale my data beore to obtain the most accurate results.

Between the two models, the Easy Ensemble Classifier had the higher balanced accuracy score of 0.945.

The Easy Ensemble Classifier had the better recall, with a weighed average score of 0.94.
Geometric mean was not included in the classification report but the Easy Ensemble Classifier had the higher F1 score of 0.97.
For the balanced random forest model, the top three features were Total Recieved Principal at 0.074, Total Recieved Interest at 0.061, and Total Payment Invested at 0.061.
